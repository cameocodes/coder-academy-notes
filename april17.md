## Stages of Design Thinking
- Empathy
    - Experiencing what your end user experiences
- Reframe
    - After listening to end user, figure out if you're solving the right challenge
- Ideate (Brainstorming)
    - Quantity of ideas over quality
    - No idea is a bad idea
- Prototype
    - Making a visual representation of your idea
- Testing
    - Bring prototypes to end users and let them give you feedback, then go back to prototyping
